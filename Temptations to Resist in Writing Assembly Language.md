 * Temptations to resist

I see many tempted to:

1. not use working pseudo<br/>
  * thinking the problem is simple and doesn't need it (even for simple things we often don't have sufficient clarity to take that to assembly language when we're first leaning assembly), 
  * thinking that it will slow you down (it won't, it will speed you up), 

2. Making algorithmic changes when translating into assembly language, such as 
  * converting an algorithm from arrays and indexing variables to using pointers variables instead
  * converting a while loop into a do while loop

Do these transformations in C and make sure they work, instead of during translation to assembly

---

* I recommend using logical transformations to take your pseudo code into assembly language.&nbsp; Small steps repeated as needed.

* Be proficient at single step debugging &#8212; learn it in your other languages first, and do it in assembly language.

* Don't write a ton of code before assembling it &#8212; write small sections, assemble, run, test & debug them.
