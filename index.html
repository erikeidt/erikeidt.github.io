    <h3>Translating High Level language into Assembly Language & Machine Code</h3>

    If you are learning assembly language or compiler technology you may find some of these blogs of interest.

          <a href="The-Double-E-Method">An efficient and accurate approach to Infix Expression Parsing</a>
          This is a method for parsing infix expressions such as we find in most languages like C, having many levels of precedence, and a rich set of operators with static operator precedence.  It is a bottoms-up approach to parsing similar to general purpose shift-reduce parsing, though dedicated to and simplified for infix expressions â€” meaning parse state tables are replaced by two states, each represented by their own code section.  It is as simple as the Shunting Yard algorithm, though is also industrial strength, without the well-known limitations of the former (e.g. operator support and error detection).

          is about how high level language and assembly language differ, and what concepts you should look out for in learning assembly language.

          <a href="Transforming%20Structured%20Statements%20into%20Assembly%20Language">Transforming Structured Statements into Assembly Language</a>
          is about how to rewrite familiar constructs of if-then, if-then-else, while-do, etc.. 
          in the available control structures of assembly languages, namely: an if-goto style that uses 
          only labels to identify branch targets, goto for unconditional branching, and if-goto for conditional branching.&nbsp;</div><br>

          <div>
          It details specific transformations required to reduce and simplify these structured statements 
          as well as transformations and optmizations for individual operators such as short-circut boolean operators like && and || 
          as well as negation (!) since negation comes up so often in the transform from structure statements.&nbsp;</div><br>
