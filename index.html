    <a href="Transforming%20Structured%20Statements%20into%20Assembly%20Language">Transforming Structured Statements into Assembly Language]</a>
      is about how to transform, write, or rewrite common constructs of if-then, if-then-else, while-do, etc.. into
      in assembly languages.&nbsp; 
      It details the transformations required to reduce and simplify these structured statements 
      into the control structures available in assembly languages, namely, the if-goto style that uses 
      only labels to identify branch targets, goto for unconditional branching, and if-goto for conditional branching.
      Basic optimizations applicable to assembly language programming and code generation are discussed,
      as are transformations of short-circut boolean operators like && and || into assembly languages if-goto style.
