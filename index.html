    <h3>Translating High Level language into Assembly Language & Machine Code</h3>

    If you are learning assembly language or compiler technology you may find some of these blogs of interest.

          <a href="Introduction%20to%20Concepts%20in%20Assembly%20Language%20&%20Machine Code">Introduction to Concepts in Assembly Language & Machine Code</a>
          is about how high level language and assembly language differ, and what concepts you should look out for in learning assembly language.

        <div>
          <a href="Transforming%20Structured%20Statements%20into%20Assembly%20Language">Transforming Structured Statements into Assembly Language</a>
          is about how to rewrite familiar constructs of if-then, if-then-else, while-do, etc.. 
          in the available control structures of assembly languages, namely: an if-goto style that uses 
          only labels to identify branch targets, goto for unconditional branching, and if-goto for conditional branching.&nbsp;</div><br>

          <div>
          It details specific transformations required to reduce and simplify these structured statements 
          as well as transformations and optmizations for individual operators such as short-circut boolean operators like && and || 
          as well as negation (!) since negation comes up so often in the transform from structure statements.&nbsp;</div><br>


          <div>Hopefully, this material is of value to the endeavours of assembly language programming and code generation.</div>
