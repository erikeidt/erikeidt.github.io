<h3>Assembly Language and Code Generation</h3>

If you are learning assembly language or compiler technology you may find some of these blogs of interest.

    <a href="Transforming%20Structured%20Statements%20into%20Assembly%20Language">Transforming Structured Statements into Assembly Language</a>
      is about how to rewrite familiar constructs of if-then, if-then-else, while-do, etc.. 
      in the available control structures of assembly languages, namely: an if-goto style that uses 
      only labels to identify branch targets, goto for unconditional branching, and if-goto for conditional branching.<br/>
    
      It details specific transformations required to reduce and simplify these structured statements 
      as well as transformations and optmizations for individual operators such as short-circut boolean operators like && and || 
      as well as negation (!) since negation comes up so often in the transform from structure statements.<br/>
    
      Hopefully, this material is of value to the endeavours of assembly language programming and code generation.
